            [Chorus]
            Baby, probably in a fast car
            Ridin' with the cap off (Zoom)
            Pull off with a bad broad (Bad broad, ooh, ooh)
            Think a nigga got here cappin'
            I am not these rappers
            You gon' have to cap yo' ass off, and back on that big homie (Big)
            Hop out that bitch, whip that shit on 'em, okay (d.a. got that dope)
            Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it
            Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em (Huh)
            Red light, green light (Boom, boom)

            [Verse 1]
            I'm fuckin' a bitch in my G Nikes (Let's go)
            I hop out with that stick with that beam, like
            My partner want see something killed, that's what he like (Someone die)
            So the first nigga tried gon' tell G "Hi"
            I been bout that motherfuckin' sack since a knee-high (Since a knee)
            This is a nappy-haired, black, afro'ed peon (Let's go)
            I have emotion, I'm primetime like Deion
            Now she throw it, I'll snatch from the behind (Huh)
            Hol' up, look at the fit on him (Look at the fit)
            Go get the tissue, there's shit on him (Shit)
            Lie for me, die for me, kill for me (Shit)
            Dick in the butt, though, she lick on me (Okay)
            I told her, "Babe, show me you love me" (Okay, show me, baby)
            "Let 'em know out in public" (Let 'em know)
            "Uh-huh, let 'em know why we fuckin'"
            They try me and go down, and know why I'm comin' (Doot, doot, doot)
            Yuh, rich ass stepper (Bitch) (The biggest)
            White seats, bitch, that's leather (White seats)
            I wanna fuck her and her friend
            All her birds are the same feather
            They flock together (Let's go)
            I'm dangerous, they probably tell you (What they say?)
            "Don't play with him," they 'bout whatever (Don't play)
            Uh, I get in there, she say I'm precious (Get in there)
            Anywhere, anytime, bitch, whoever
            But hold up

            [Chorus]
            Baby, probably in a fast car

            [Verse 2]
            Nigga touch one of yours, he gon' see right
            I'ma spend every dollar 'til he die
            I make him slide, 365, he don't think right
            That's eleven months straight, niggas sleep tight
            I tried to be patient when niggas, that ain't right (Nigga try)
            Give them game they couldn't take, niggas ain't in (Uh uh)
            Rate me, one out of ten, they gon' say ten (Say ten)
            Threw that bad bitch on camera, let bae in (Okay)
            Who that is back to back, ho, that's Baby
            Can't do no shows, he fills stadiums
            I like my Lamborghinis 'cause they drive fast (Okay)
            But the Maybach is probably my favorite whip
            I'm in the backseat with my feet up with client (Back, back)
            Get my dick rolled like a Mercedes Benz
            And I pop big shits, so I don't trip when they talk
            When you dish shit out, you gotta take it in (Okay, okay)
            I be like, hold up

            [Chorus]
            Baby probably in a fast car
            Ridin' with the cap off
            Pull off with a bad broad (Okay, let's go)
            Think a nigga got here cappin'
            I am not these rappers
            You gon' have to cap yo' ass off and back on that big homie (Big)
            Hop out that bitch, whip that shit on 'em (Let's go)
            Pull my dick out, sit me down, and she sit on it (Okay)
            Give them niggas a green light, they gon' get on 'em (Brrr)
